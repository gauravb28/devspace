The sizable number of people over the last 3 years who are considering leaving their jobs aren’t just looking for new ones with better benefits or salaries. Some see it as a chance to start their own companies and the result is a massive boom of entrepreneurs and start-ups, collectively the entrepreunership.

These words sound fancy, but what's the actual meaning of these fancy terms “Entrepreneurship & Entrepreneurs” that have made the youth go crazy about starting their own business, **“Mai to Dhandha Karunga bhai”**, as stated by a junior during a college orientation.

Entrepreneurship is the process of starting and running a business venture, especially when this involves taking financial risks. Entrepreneurship can involve a wide range of activities, including developing new products or services, identifying and targeting new markets, building and managing teams, and raising capital to fund the business. It often requires a combination of creativity, strategic thinking, and hard work, as well as the ability to identify and take advantage of opportunities and navigate challenges. 

The goal of entrepreneurship is typically to create value for customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders, as well as to generate financial returns for the entrepreneur and the business. Successful entrepreneurship requires the ability to identify and solve problems, to be adaptable and flexible, and to continuously learn and grow. Entrepreneurship can be a rewarding career path, but it also requires a lot of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. 

Isn't it impressive, but entrepreneurship in an easy way can be defined as the **“took the road less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.”** Because things don't come out easy as successful entrepreneurship requires the ability to identify and solve problems, to be adaptable and flexible, and to continuously learn and grow. Entrepreneurship can be a rewarding career path, but it also requires a lot, really a lot of hard work, dedication, and perseverance.

Coming to the second term, Entrepreneurs are individuals who start and run their own businesses. They are typically driven, innovative, and take calculated risks in order to turn their ideas into successful ventures. Entrepreneurs are often visionaries who are able to identify unmet needs in the market and develop creative solutions to meet those needs. They are responsible for all aspects of their businesses, including identifying and evaluating business opportunities, developing and implementing business strategies, and managing financial and human resources. They may work in a variety of industries, including retail, manufacturing, technology, and service-based businesses. Many entrepreneurs are motivated by a desire to be their own boss, create something new and innovative, and achieve financial independence.

For a better explanation, considering you all as a child, then the suitable analogy I could come up with would be, An entrepreneur is like a gardener who has an idea for a beautiful garden. They come up with a plan for what types of flowers and plants they want to grow, and then they work hard to turn that idea into a reality. They might need to buy seeds and soil, prepare the ground, and water and care for the plants as they grow.

Just like a gardener, an entrepreneur has to be patient and persistent. It takes time for a garden to grow, and there might be challenges along the way, such as pests or bad weather. But with hard work and dedication, a gardener can create a beautiful and thriving garden.
