Whenever you find that there is something you can add more value to with your available skills, or if there is a viable solution that no one has discovered yet and you are the first to think of it. Then you should write it down, dive deeper and explore more about it.

**_How will that idea work for You?_**
In response to this question, you do not need to do anything so differently. Success of most startups is attributed to the right timing and right market conditions when they were launched. You just need to figure out whether the market is ready to accept your product.

**_Is your idea capable of making money?_**
Even if the market is suitable, there is a possibility that your business may shut down soon because it's not making money. Though it's tough to predict the revenue you will be making, but a  concrete business plan can help you in raising the probability of your business to make money
