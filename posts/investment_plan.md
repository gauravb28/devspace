Inflation, GDP, interest rates, ratings and a lot more things affect the stock prices but how will you know what kind of impact will be made on different stocks?

Demand and supply of a particular stock, internal matters of company, growth prospects, cash flows are some factors which directly impact the stock prices of that particular company but what
about macro economic factors, do they also have any kind of impact?

The answer is yes. Every macro economic factor has some kind of impact on the stock prices but it depends industry to industry.

But it is really difficult for a human being to calculate the impact of any changes in all these factors on the markets or the industries, but if we use AI then we can decode the impact of such changes.

Moreover; On Thursday, ADB(Asian Development Bank) lowered India's growth forecast to 7.2% for financial year 2022-23 due to surging prices of food and fuel.

The reasons given for this was worsening fallout of war in Ukraine, resurfacing fear of COVID in India and inflation.
The inflation rate was 7.01% in June 2022 and is expected to remain above the reserve banks' tolerance band of 2-6%.

Inflation, being the biggest factor of this announcement, is rising rapidly in most of the Asian countries like Mongolia, Sri Lanka, Laos and Myanmar.

The cost of living will also increase over the years but your salary hike won't be able to match the inflation rate.

So do you think you'll be able to sustain in these situations?
No right, you should plan your future expenditure and start investing.

Prepare your Investing plan before you prepare your spending plan!

This way you won't spend on the things which you don't really need.

Risk is to be managed, not avoided; so make your money work for you instead of just running behind it.
