Macroeconomics is the study of how an entire economy—markets, corporations, consumers, and governments—behaves. Macroeconomics studies economic phenomena such as inflation, price levels, economic growth rate, national income, GDP, and variations in unemployment.

Macroeconomics addresses several crucial problems, including: What causes unemployment? What factors contribute to inflation? What causes or promotes economic growth? Macroeconomics seeks to quantify an economy's performance, understand what forces drive it, and forecast how performance may improve.

Macroeconomics, as the name suggests, is an area of study that examines an economy through a broad lens. This involves examining indicators such as unemployment, GDP, and inflation. Furthermore, macroeconomists create models that explain the interactions between these components.

These models and the projections they provide are used by government agencies to assist in the development and evaluation of economic, monetary, and fiscal policy. Businesses utilize the models to develop strategies in domestic and global markets, while investors use them to forecast and prepare for asset class fluctuations.

Economic theories, when used correctly, may provide light on how economies work and the long-term ramifications of certain policies and actions. Macroeconomic theory may also assist individual firms and investors in making better decisions by providing a more comprehensive knowledge of the implications of broad economic trends and policies on their respective industry.

## A Brief History 

Although the word "macroeconomics" is relatively new (dating from the 1940s), many of its fundamental ideas have been the subject of research for much longer. Since the discipline's inception in the 1700s, issues including unemployment, pricing, growth, and trade have been of interest to economists. Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill wrote previously on topics that are today acknowledged as falling under the purview of macroeconomics.

Macroeconomics is frequently characterized as having its contemporary origins in John Maynard Keynes' 1936 book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money. Keynes provided an explanation of the effects of the Great Depression, including the unsold commodities and unemployment.

Prior to the popularization of Keynes' theories, economists did not distinguish between micro- and macroeconomics. As stated by Leon Walras, the same microeconomic rules of supply and demand that operate in individual goods markets were recognized to interact between individual markets to bring the economy into general equilibrium.

## Contrast to microeconomics

Macroeconomics is distinct from microeconomics, which focuses on minor elements that influence individual and corporate decisions. Microeconomic and macroeconomic factors frequently interact with one another.

A significant difference between microeconomics and macroeconomics is that macroeconomic aggregates can occasionally react quite differently, or even opposite, to equivalent microeconomic variables. Keynes, for example, referred to the so-called Paradox of Thrift, which contends that people save money in order to accumulate wealth (micro). When everyone attempts to raise their savings at the same time, the economy slows and there is less wealth in the aggregate (macro). This is due to a drop in expenditure, which would reduce corporate revenues and lower worker compensation.

Microeconomics, on the other hand, examines economic trends, or what can occur when people do particular actions. Subgroups of people, such consumers, sellers, and company owners, are often defined. Utilizing money and interest rates as price mechanisms for coordination, these players communicate with one another in accordance with the rules of supply and demand for resources.
