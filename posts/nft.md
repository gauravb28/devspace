Now you might wonder what is so Special about this picture? 

Well this picture is a NFT (Non fungible token) . What is a NFT ?

Has it some intrinsic value or just a bubble? 

How is it different from normal Digital arts? 

All of these questions we are going to Explore in this Article! 

Non fungible token or better known as NFTs is a unique digital identifier that cannot be copied, substituted, or subdivided, that is recorded in a blockchain, and that is used to certify authenticity and ownership. 

Well this definition is quite complicated to understand at First, but we will Simply break it down in simple terms!

The word fungible means that the quality of an asset can be exchanged with another asset of the same type.

For example:-

You are in a sports shop, And you are buying a ball. You decide the ball brand, type etc. And Simply purchased the ball.

It doesn't matter which ball you are buying. That ball might have come from the second box or the third box. It doesn't matter as you are getting the ball of the same brand, color,price. This is known as fungibility.

Now you are playing with that ball for like 2 months. Now the ball is unique!
It experiences the Ground, bat hits, wicket hits that other balls of the same kind didn't. This ball is non fungible as no ball in this world can replace this!

How is this related to NFT or Digital arts being sold for millions of dollars? 

Well the NFT that I have shown above is downloaded from the internet. But who actually owns this picture?
Well, that is a tricky part to answer!
But Blockchain got us covered! 

NFT is Simply a Digital Art or picture that has an ID associated with it and whoever First has access to that ID is Simply the owner of that Picture(NFT). Using blockchain technology we can solve the issue of ownership and boom we now know the owner of that NFT. 

NFT came out with the concept of providing the ownership of Digital Art.
A small change in the image leads to change in the ID of the image and hence it provides validation of authenticity. It can't be robbed. It is verifiable(Thanks to Blockchain)!

But the main question that still is very not much cleared?
Why This image sold for 69 Million dollars?

Well a NFT is a non fungible token that can be traded, and Based on demand and supply, Its price is being decided. Someone agrees to take the ownership of this image at 69 million dollars! Thatâ€™s it!
