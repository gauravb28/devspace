# INTRODUCTION

In the simplest terms possible, pivoting means changing your ideas. Fundamentally, pivoting is changing the direction of a business when something just doesn’t seem to be working. Business pivots can be difficult, but they are often essential for entrepreneurs to adapt and survive in an ever-changing market.

During the pandemic, many restaurants offering fine dining shifted to only delivery services. After the pandemic, while some restaurants returned to the old way of doing things, many others stuck with this change. This is an example of a business pivot.

# TYPES OF BUSINESS PIVOTS

There are several ways in which businesses pivot. We'll discuss the three types of business pivots: product pivot, market pivot, and business model pivot.

Let’s go over an example of each of these to understand them better.

    I. PRODUCT PIVOT

**Apple:** began as a computer firm but has since made multiple product pivots, including the release of the iPod, iPhone, and iPad.

    II. MARKET PIVOT

**Nike:** began as a tiny firm that sold running shoes to athletes but has now grown to become a global lifestyle brand.

     III. BUSINESS MODEL PIVOT

**Netflix:** began as a DVD rental service but shifted to a streaming service, altering its business model and considerably increasing its client base.


# WHY PIVOT? AND WHEN?

Companies in their early stages are continually changing their ideas, trying new things, learning and adapting. This is not unusual; it is simply the norm. Thus, in the beginning, pivoting is pretty lightweight.

It is only when you’re a company that has raised a lot of money and has employees whose jobs depend on the company that pivoting seems risky and uncertain.


#### *Reasons to pivot:*

- You don’t like working on it.
- Your company’s not growing.
- You’re not a good fit for the idea.
- You are relying on an external factor outside of your control (ex: crypto adoption) to make your startup take off.
- You’re out of ideas on what to do differently to make it start working.


#### *Reasons not to pivot:*

- You are trying to run away from doing the hard work.
- You are repeatedly changing your ideas and giving up on them before launching and making sales.
- You read about a hot trend that is currently popular with investors and want to chase it.


# HOW TO PIVOT YOUR BUSINESS

There are several steps that you can take to effectively pivot your business.

I. **Identify the need for a pivot** - This could be due to market developments, changes in client needs, or a shift in your own business objectives.

II. **Assess your current business strategy** - Understanding your strengths and weaknesses can guide your business pivot.

III. **Identify new opportunities** -  A new product or service offering, a shift in the target audience, or a change in distribution channels.

IV. **Develop a plan** - for how to pivot your business strategy

V. **Communicate the pivot to your team** -  It is critical that everyone knows why the pivot is being made and how it will affect their function and the business as a whole.

VI. **Stay flexible** - Pivoting can be a challenging process. Thus, it is imperative to stay open to adapting as needed.


# IN CONCLUSION 

*Don’t quit; pivot.*
